Step 1: Setting Up the Network Topology
1.	Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2.	Add devices:
o	Drag and drop a Cisco switch (e.g., 2960) onto the workspace.
o	Drag and drop two or more PCs onto the workspace.
3.	Connect devices:
o	Use the Connections option to select the Copper Straight-Through cable.
o	Connect each PC to the switch using the FastEthernet ports (e.g., PC0 to FastEthernet0/1, PC1 to FastEthernet0/2).
Step 2: Configuring the Switch
1.	Open the CLI (Command-Line Interface) of the switch:
o	Click on the switch and go to the CLI tab.
Step 3: Configuring PCs
1.	Assign IP addresses to PCs:
o	Click on each PC and go to the Desktop tab.
o	Open the IP Configuration and assign an IP address within the same subnet as the switch's VLAN 1 interface. For example:
	PC0: IP Address: 192.168.1.2, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
	PC1: IP Address: 192.168.1.3, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Step 4: Testing Connectivity
1.	Ping between PCs:
o	Open the Command Prompt on one of the PCs (e.g., PC0).
o	Use the ping command to check connectivity to the other PC (e.g., ping 192.168.1.3).
