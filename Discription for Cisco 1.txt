1. Build a Simple Network:
Add two PCs and a switch to the workspace.
Connect the PCs to the switch using copper straight-through cables.
2. Configure IP Addresses:
Assign IP addresses to the PCs (e.g., PC1: 192.168.1.1, PC2: 192.168.1.2).
Ensure both PCs are in the same subnet.
3.Test Connectivity:
Use the ping command from one PC to the other to test network connectivity.
Observe the packet flow in simulation mode to understand how data travels through the network.
